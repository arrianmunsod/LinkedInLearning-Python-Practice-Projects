# Yeah, I know. What I'm doing is super basic. I haven't coded in years, since I've been working
# as an IT Technician / IT Support / System Administrator. I'm doing this for practice.

# variables can't start with numbers
# never start a variable name with an upper case because it can get confused with a class
# you can use both single quotes and double quotes for strings in python

variable1 = 69
print(variable1)

# you can use type() to identify the date type of something
type(variable1)

# you can concatenate strings using the + sign
var1 = "Good morning, "
var2 = "Mister "
variable_concatenate_example = var1 + var2
print(variable_concatenate_example)

# adding "1" + 1 will result in error because they are different data types

# Booleans start with a capital letter: True or False   - super important
# because if you used a small letter, it will try to interpret it as a variable
