# Yeah, I know. What I'm doing is super basic. I haven't coded in years, since I've been working
# as an IT Technician / IT Support / System Administrator. I'm doing this for practice.

# List is represented by opening and closing bracket
my_list = [1,2,3,4]
print(my_list)

# you can have integers, strings, floats, booleans, or another list inside a list
# you can have nested lists
my_list_02 = ["banana", False, 24]
print(len(my_list_02))
# len() count how many values are inside the list


my_list_03 = [[1,2,3],[False,True],["basketball","football"]]

# Set is almost identical to list, except that all of the elements in it have to be unique
# curly bracket is used
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set)
