# Yeah, I know. What I'm doing is super basic. I haven't coded in years, since I've been working
# as a System Administrator.

# variables can't start with numbers
# never start a variable name with an upper case because it can get confused with a class
# you can use both single quotes and double quotes for strings in python

variable1 = 69
print(variable1)

# you can use type() to identify the date type of something
type(variable1)
